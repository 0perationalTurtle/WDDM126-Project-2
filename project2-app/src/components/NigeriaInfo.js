      <h3>A little bit About Nigeria</h3>
      <p>Nigeria is a vibrant country in West Africa known for its rich culture, diverse ethnic groups, and dynamic economy. With over 200 million people, it's the most populous country in Africa and has more than 250 ethnic groups, including the Yoruba, Hausa, and Igbo. Nigeria's culture is reflected in its music, dance, art, and cuisine, with Afrobeat, a popular music genre, originating here. The country is also famous for its natural landscapes, from tropical rainforests to savannas, and is home to notable attractions like the Zuma Rock, the Obudu Mountain Resort, and the Niger River. Economically, Nigeria is one of the largest oil producers globally, yet it's also diversifying into other sectors like technology and agriculture.</p>
